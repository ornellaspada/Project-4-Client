          <div className='column'> When in the chronicle of wasted time
          I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
          And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
          In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
          Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,
          Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
          I see their antique pen would have express’d
          Even such a beauty as you master now.
          So all their praises are but prophecies
          Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
          And, for they look’d but with divining eyes,
          They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
          For we, which now behold these present days,
          Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.

          2. Sonnet 138
          
          When my love swears that she is made of truth
          I do believe her, though I know she lies,
          That she might think me some untutor’d youth
          Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties.
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Although she knows my days are past the best,
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress’d.
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
O, love’s best habit is in seeming trust,
And age in love loves not to have years told:
Therefore I lie with her and she with me,
And in our faults by lies we flatter’d be.</div>
